# Hate_Data
This is a Twitter Data set to analyze the each tweet and predict the accuracy of the negative comments.

In this I have used basic NLP to clean the dataset.
Implemented wordcloud to visualize the text data to get a better idea.
Added certain features to the present data to get the better results.
Finally implemented NaiveBaies ML Algorithm to see the accuracy of the model.
